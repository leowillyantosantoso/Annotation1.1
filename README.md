  - Our experiments suggest that gNa and 9E are functions of time and membrane potential, but that ENa, EK, El, CM and g, may be taken as
constant.
  - In order to decide whether these effects are sufficient to account for complicated phenomena such as the action potential and refractory period, it is necessary to obtain expressions relating MEMBRANE CURRENT IN NERVE the sodium and potassium conductances to time and membrane potential.
  - RNw and RK vary with time and membrane potential; the other components are constant.
  - At a fixed depolarization the sodium current follows a time course whose form is inde-pendent of the current through the membrane.
  - If the sodium concentration is such that ENaB<E, the sodium current is inward; if it is reduced until
ENa > E the current changes in sign but still appears to follow the same time course.
  - Since we now know that the sodium current takes an appreciable time to reach its maximum, it is necessary to suppose
that there are more carriers and that they react or move more slowly.
  - The proportion of the time that each of the charged molecules spends at the inside is determined by exp -E/25 so that the proportion of sites at which all
six are at the inside is exp - E/4.17.
  - Details of the mechanism will probably not be settled for some time, but it seems difficult to escape the conclusion that the changes
in ionic permeability depend on the movement of some component of the membrane which behaves as though it had a large charge or dipole moment.
  - Thus I = CM d+ i,

MEMBRANE CURRENT IN NERVE where
I is the total membrane current density (inward current positive);
Ii is the ionic current density (inward current positive);
V is the displacement of the membrane potential from its resting value (depolarization negative);
CM is the membrane capacity per unit area (assumed constant);
t is time.
  - The justification for this equation is that it is the simplest which can be used and that it gives values for the membrane capacity which are independent of
the magnitude or sign of V and are little affected by the time course of V (see, for example, table 1 of Hodgkin et al.
  - There is no simple way of estimating the error introduced by this approximation, but it is not thought
to be large since the time course of the capacitative surge was reasonably close to that calculated for a perfect condenser (Hodgkin et al.
  - The ionic conductances The discussion in Part I shows that there is little hope of calculating the time course of the sodium and potassium conductances from first principles.
  - A similar assumption using a cube instead of a fourth power describes the initial rise of sodium con-ductance, but a term representing inactivation must be included to cover the behaviour at long times.
  - The potassium conductance The formal assumptions used to describe the potassium conductance are:

where g is a constant with the dimensions of conductance/cm2, cx and /n are rate constants which vary with voltage but not with time and have
dimensions of [time]-', n is a dimensionless variable which can vary between 0 and 1.
  - The time scale applies to all records.
  - 4, time constant used to compute curve; col.
  - The time scale applies to all curves.
  - Summary of equations and parameters We may first collect the equations which give the total membrane current I as a function of time and voltage.
  - The conductances to K and Na are given by the constants gK and 9NaX together with the dimension-
less quantities n, m and h, whose variation with time after a change of membrane potential is determined by the three subsidiary equations (7), (15)
and (16).
  - Potentials are given in mV, current density in IzA/cm2, conductances in m.mho/cm2, capacity in juF/cm2, and time in msec.
  - Left-hand column: time course of membrane current during voltage clamp, calculated for temperature of 40 C from eqn.
  - Right-hand column: observed time course of membrane currents during voltage clamp.
  - The time scale changes between d, D and e, E.
  - During steady propagation, however, the curve of V against time at any one position is similar in shape to that of V against distance
at any one time, and it follows that a2v 1 a2v ax2= 2 at2) where 0 is the velocity of conduction.
  - 26 shows that the same result is achieved by calculating the action potential at 6.30 C with a membrane capacity of#CMj!F/cm2, the unit of time being 1/0 msec.
  - After several runs had been calculated, so that K was known within fairly narrow limits, time was saved by starting new runs not from near V = 0 but from a set of values interpolated between
corresponding points on a run which had gone towards + oo and another which had gone towards - o.
  - had become almost identical with the 15 mV action potential, apart from the displacement in time.
  - It will be seen that the general agreement is good, as regards amplitude, form and time-scale.
  - 13 in which a pair of curves are plotted on a slower time scale.
  - This is the justification for the differences in time scale between the upper and lower parts in Figs.
  - 15 compares the calculated pro-pagated action potential, at 18.50 C, with experimental records on both fast and slow time bases.
  - B, same solution plotted on slower time scale.

Impedance changes
Time course of conductance change.
  - The broken curve shows the membrane action potential in mV; the continuous curve shows the total membrane conductance (gN +g9 +9) as a function of time.
  - The time scales are the same in A and B.
  - The time scale is the same inBas inA, and the curves have been drawn with the same peak height.
  - Thus (1) the main rise in conductance begins later than the rise of
potential; (2) the conductance does not fall to its resting value until late in
the positive phase; and (3) the peak of the conductance change occurs at nearly the same time as the peak of potential.
  - The exact time relation between the peaks depends on the conditions, as can be seen from Table 4.
  - Ionic movements Time course ofionic currents.
  - The time course ofthe components ofmembrane current carried by sodium and potassium ions during the calculated pro-pagated spike is shown in Fig.
  - Refractory period Time course of inactivation and delayed rectification.
  - According to our theory, there are two changes resulting from the depolarization during a spike which make the membrane unable to respond to another stimulus until a certain time has elapsed.
  - Lower curves show time course of 9E and h during action potential and refractory period.
  - We calculated the responses of the membrane when it was suddenly depolarized by 90 mV at various times during the positive phase of the membrane action potential at 6Â° C.
  - Curves B to D show effect of applying 90 mucoulomb/cm2 at various times after curve A.
  - The time scales differ by a factor appropriate to the temperature difference.
  - HUXLEY to bring the membrane potential to 30 mV above the resting potential was suddenly stopped after passing for a time long compared with all the time-constants of the membrane.
  - The curves have been replotted from records taken at low amplification and a relatively high time-base speed.
  - A spike resulted, and the time course of membrane potential is plotted in Fig.
  - These effects persist for an appreciable time so that the membrane potential reaches its resting value with a reduced outward potassium current and an increased inward sodium current.
  - Time scales differ by a factor appropriate to the temperature difference.
  - 21A and 24, but the action potentials are not plotted on a slow enough time base or with a large enough vertical scale to show the oscillations which follow the positive phase.

where p represents d/dt, the operation of differentiating with respect to time.
  - This can be solved by standard methods for any particular time course of the applied current density SI.
  - The curve shows 8V/8I (plotted upwards) as a function of time.
  - C, similar records from another fibre enlarged to have same time scale.
  - The agreement must not be taken as evidence that our equations are any-thing more than an empirical description of the time-course of the changes in
permeability to sodium and potassium.
  - The early rise of potassium conductance prevents the potential from getting as close to the socdium potential, and from staying there for as long a time, as it should.
  - The parameters in these equations were determined by fitting solutions to the experimental curves relating sodium or potassium conductance to time at various membrane potentials.
